# Variables

Variables are used to store temporary data. They are defined using the `let` keyword followed by the variable name, a type annotation, and an initial value. For example:

```ts
let x: int = 42;
let flag: bool = true;
```

In this example, a variable named `x` of type `int` is defined with an initial value of `42`, and a variable named `flag` of type `bool` is defined with an initial value of `true`.

## Variable Scope

Variables have a scope that determines where they can be accessed. If you define a variable inside a block of code, it can only be accessed within that block. For example:

```ts
if (true) {
    let x: int = 42;
}
// x is not accessible here
// and you can define `x` here without any conflicts
let x: bool = true;
```
