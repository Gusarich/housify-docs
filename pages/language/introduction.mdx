# Introduction

Housify is an advanced programming language and compiler specifically designed for Hypixel Housing.

This section of the documentation provides an overview of the Housify language, its syntax, and features.

## What is it for?

Housify allows you to program Hypixel Housing plots using a simple, intuitive and yet powerful language. You can create anything from simple counters to complex games and interactive experiences, while taking advantage of the scalable and extensible nature of the language.

## How does it work?

Housify modules are compiled into a JSON format that can be deployed to your Hypixel Housing plot using the **HousingKit** plugin. Currently, only the compiler is available, but the plugin is under development and will be released soon.
