# Conditions

Conditions are used to check if a certain condition is met and execute some actions based on the result. They are defined using the `if` keyword followed by a condition and a block of code enclosed in curly braces. For example:

```hsf
if (score > 100) {
    // Do something
}
```

In this example, the code inside the block will only be executed if the condition `score > 100` is true.

## Branching

You can use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to create branching logic based on multiple conditions. For example:

```hsf
if (score > 100) {
    // Do something
} else if (score > 50) {
    // Do something else
} else {
    // Do something different
}
```

In this example, the first block will be executed if `score > 100`, the second block will be executed if `score > 50` but not `score > 100`, and the third block will be executed if neither condition is true.
