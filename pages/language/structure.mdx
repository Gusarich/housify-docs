# Module Structure

Housify module is a collection of houses, each of which defines a set of stats and event handlers. This section provides an overview of the structure of a Housify module.

## House

A house is a container for stats and event handlers. It is defined using the `house` keyword followed by the house name and a block of code enclosed in curly braces. For example:

```ts
house MyHouse {
    // Stats and event handlers go here
}
```

## Stats

Read more about [Stats](/language/stats).

Stats are variables that store data associated with a house. They can be global or player-specific. Global stats are shared across all players, while player stats are specific to each player. Stats are defined using the `global` or `player` keyword followed by the stat type and name. Stat definitions must be placed before event handlers. For example:

```ts
house MyHouse {
    global counter: int;
    player score: int;

    // Event handlers go here
}
```

## Event Handlers

Read more about [Event Handlers](/language/handlers).

Event handlers are functions that respond to events triggered by players or the game. They are defined using the `handle` keyword followed by the event name and a block of code enclosed in curly braces. Event handlers must be placed after stat definitions. For example:

```ts
house MyHouse {
    global counter: int;

    handle JOIN {
        global.counter = global.counter + 1;
    }

    // More event handlers go here
}
```
