# Overview

This part of the documentation contains examples of Housify modules. These examples are designed to help you understand how to use Housify. Each example includes a detailed description with code snippets and explanations.

## Join Counter

The Join Counter example demonstrates how to create a simple counter that increments every time a player joins the plot.

```hsf
house Counter {
    global counter: int;

    handle JOIN {
        global.counter = global.counter + 1;
    }
}
```

This example defines a house named `ExampleHouse` with a global stat `counter`. The `JOIN` event handler increments the `counter` stat by `1` every time a player joins the plot. You can then use the stat in other parts of code or even manually as `%stat.global/counter%` placeholder.

## Simple Clicker Game

The Simple Clicker Game example demonstrates how to create a simple clicker game where players can break blocks to increase their score.

```hsf
house ClickerGame {
    player score: int;

    handle BLOCK_BREAK {
        player.score = player.score + 1;
    }
}
```
