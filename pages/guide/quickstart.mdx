# Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with the Housify in a few minutes.

## Install Housify

To install the Housify compiler, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website.

After installing Node.js, you can install the Housify compiler using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g housify
```

## Create a source file

Create a new file with the `.hsf` extension. This file will contain your Housify code. For example, you can create a file named `hello.hsf` with the following content:

```ts
house MyBeautifulHouse {
    global counter: int;

    handle JOIN {
        global.counter = global.counter + 1;
    }
}
```

## Compile the source file

To compile the source file, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
hsf hello.hsf
```

This command will compile the `hello.hsf` file and generate a `.json` file with the same name.

That's it! You have successfully compiled your first Housify module. You will be able to deploy the generated `.json` file to your Hypixel Housing plot via **HousingKit** as soon as it is released.
